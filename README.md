# App

A Symfony Project.

The goal of this project is do avoid strong coupling between
the framework (Symfony) and the domain. 


## To Do

- LocaleListener:
	- `writing-mode:rtl` for [ar, arc, dv, fa, ha, he, khw, ks, ku, ps, ur, yi]
	- `ltr vertical tb` [mn, ug]
	- `rtl vertical tb` [ja, ko, zh? (it's complicated)]
